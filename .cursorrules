# Cursor Rules for App Template

## Design System - CRITICAL RULES

### Colors - NEVER hardcode color values
- ✅ ALWAYS use semantic color tokens via Tailwind utilities: `bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`
- ✅ ALWAYS use CSS variables when needed: `var(--primary)`, `var(--muted-foreground)`
- ❌ NEVER hardcode hex/rgb values: `#3b82f6`, `rgb(59, 130, 246)`
- ❌ NEVER use raw Tailwind color scales: `bg-blue-600`, `text-slate-500`

Available semantic colors (from `app/tokens.css`):
- Base: `background`, `foreground`
- Brand: `primary`, `primary-foreground`
- UI: `secondary`, `secondary-foreground`, `muted`, `muted-foreground`, `accent`, `accent-foreground`
- Status: `success`, `success-foreground`, `warning`, `warning-foreground`, `destructive`, `destructive-foreground`
- Elements: `border`, `input`, `ring`, `card`, `card-foreground`, `popover`, `popover-foreground`

### Typography - NEVER hardcode font sizes or weights
- ✅ ALWAYS use typography utility classes: `typography-h1`, `typography-body`, `typography-small`
- ✅ For Tailwind utilities, use relative sizes: `text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg`
- ❌ NEVER hardcode font sizes: `font-size: 16px`, `text-[14px]`
- ❌ NEVER hardcode font weights: `font-weight: 600`, use `font-semibold`, `font-bold`

Available typography classes (from `app/globals.css`):
- Display: `typography-display`
- Headings: `typography-h1`, `typography-h2`, `typography-h3`, `typography-h4`, `typography-h5`, `typography-h6`
- Body: `typography-body-lg`, `typography-body`, `typography-body-sm`
- UI: `typography-small`, `typography-caption`, `typography-code`

### Spacing - Use a 4px grid
- ✅ ALWAYS use Tailwind spacing utilities: `p-4`, `m-8`, `gap-2`, `space-y-4`
- ✅ Use any spacing value that fits a 4px grid (e.g., `p-15` = 60px, `m-25` = 100px)
- ✅ Common values: `4`, `8`, `10`, `12`, `15`, `16`, `20`, `25`, `30`, `40`, `50`, `60`, `80`
- ❌ NEVER hardcode spacing: `margin: 20px`, `padding: 1.5rem`
- ❌ NEVER use arbitrary values unless absolutely necessary: `p-[13px]`

### Animations - Use design system animations
- ✅ ALWAYS use provided animation classes: `animate-fade-in`, `animate-slide-in-left`, `animate-scale-in`
- ✅ Control speed with utilities: `duration-300`, `duration-500`, `duration-1000`
- ✅ Add delays when needed: `delay-100`, `delay-200`
- ❌ NEVER create inline keyframe animations
- Remember: Entrance animations play once on mount, use with conditional rendering

## File and Directory Naming

### Next.js App Router Conventions
- ✅ Use lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case) for all directories and files
- ✅ Special files: `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`
- ✅ Route groups: `(auth)`, `(dashboard)` - use parentheses for organization without URL segments
- ✅ Dynamic routes: `[id]`, `[slug]` - use square brackets
- ✅ API routes: `app/api/route-name/route.ts`

### Component Files
- ✅ Components directory: `components/ui/component-name/component-name.tsx`
- ✅ Stories: `components/ui/component-name/component-name.stories.tsx`
- ✅ Tests: `components/ui/component-name/component-name.test.tsx`
- ✅ Component names: PascalCase in code, kebab-case for files
  - File: `button.tsx` → Export: `Button`
  - File: `card.tsx` → Exports: `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, etc.

### Other Directories
- Custom hooks: `hooks/use-hook-name.ts`
- Utilities: `lib/util-name.ts`
- Types: `types/type-name.ts`
- Tests: Co-located with source files using `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx`

## Code Style and Consistency

### TypeScript
- ✅ ALWAYS use TypeScript - never plain JavaScript
- ✅ ALWAYS define proper types for props, functions, and returns
- ✅ Use interfaces for component props: `interface ButtonProps extends React.ComponentProps<"button">`
- ✅ Use type for unions and utilities: `type Variant = "default" | "outline"`
- ✅ Leverage type inference where obvious, but prefer explicit return types for functions

### Imports
Organize imports in this order:
1. React and Next.js imports
2. Third-party libraries (alphabetically)
3. Local components (from `@/components`)
4. Local utilities (from `@/lib`)
5. Local types (from `@/types`)
6. Styles (if any)

Example:
```typescript
import * as React from "react"
import { Slot } from "@radix-ui/react-slot"
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority"

import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
```

### Component Structure (shadcn/ui Pattern)
```typescript
// 1. Import statements (organized as above)
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

// 2. Variants (if using CVA)
const componentVariants = cva(
  "base-classes",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: { /* ... */ },
      size: { /* ... */ },
    },
    defaultVariants: { /* ... */ },
  }
)

// 3. Component function with proper types
function ComponentName({
  className,
  variant,
  size,
  ...props
}: React.ComponentProps<"div"> & 
  VariantProps<typeof componentVariants>) {
  return (
    <div 
      className={cn(componentVariants({ variant, size, className }))}
      {...props}
    />
  )
}

// 4. Named exports (not default for components)
export { ComponentName, componentVariants }
```

### className Management
- ✅ ALWAYS use `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` to merge classes
- ✅ Accept `className` prop for component customization
- ✅ Order: base classes, variant classes, conditional classes, `className` prop
```typescript
className={cn(
  "base-classes",
  variantClasses,
  condition && "conditional-classes",
  className
)}
```

### Component Best Practices
- ✅ Use functional components with TypeScript
- ✅ Destructure props in function signature
- ✅ Use `React.ComponentProps<"element">` for extending native element props
- ✅ Forward refs when wrapping native elements: `React.forwardRef()`
- ✅ Use `asChild` pattern for polymorphic components (via Radix Slot)
- ✅ Add `data-slot` attributes for component identification: `data-slot="button"`

### State Management
- ✅ Use React hooks for local state: `useState`, `useReducer`
- ✅ Use Context for shared state within feature boundaries
- ✅ Consider Zustand/Jotai for global state (add when needed)
- ❌ Don't prop drill more than 2-3 levels deep

### Error Handling
- ✅ Use `loading.tsx` for loading states (Suspense boundaries)
- ✅ Use `error.tsx` for error boundaries
- ✅ Provide meaningful error messages
- ✅ Handle async operations with try-catch

## Documentation and Comments

### Component Documentation
- ✅ Add JSDoc comments for complex components
- ✅ Document props that aren't self-explanatory
- ✅ Include usage examples for reusable utilities
```typescript
/**
 * Primary button component supporting multiple variants.
 * 
 * @example
 * <Button variant="outline" size="lg">Click me</Button>
 */
```

### Inline Comments
- ✅ Explain WHY, not WHAT (code should be self-documenting)
- ✅ Comment complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- ✅ Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- ❌ Don't comment obvious code

### File Headers
Add headers to utility files and complex components:
```typescript
/**
 * Button Component
 * 
 * A versatile button component built on shadcn/ui patterns.
 * Supports multiple variants, sizes, and can render as different elements.
 */
```

## Accessibility

- ✅ ALWAYS include proper ARIA labels: `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`
- ✅ ALWAYS use semantic HTML: `<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`
- ✅ Ensure keyboard navigation works: `tabIndex`, focus states
- ✅ Use `htmlFor` on `<Label>` components to connect to inputs
- ✅ Include focus-visible styles (already in base styles)
- ✅ Test with keyboard only navigation

## Testing

### Test Files
- ✅ Co-locate tests with components: `button.test.tsx` next to `button.tsx`
- ✅ Use descriptive test names: `it("should render with primary variant")`
- ✅ Test user interactions, not implementation details
- ✅ Use React Testing Library patterns

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Test all component variants and states
- ✅ Test error conditions
- ✅ Test accessibility features
- ❌ Don't test Tailwind classes (test behavior, not styles)

## Performance

- ✅ Use `next/image` for images (automatic optimization)
- ✅ Use `next/link` for internal navigation
- ✅ Import icons from lucide-react (tree-shakeable)
- ✅ Lazy load heavy components: `React.lazy()` with `Suspense`
- ✅ Use `npm run analyze` to monitor bundle size
- ❌ Don't import entire icon libraries

## Storybook

### Story Files
- ✅ Create stories for all UI components
- ✅ Name stories: `component-name.stories.tsx`
- ✅ Include all variants and states
- ✅ Add documentation and usage examples
- ✅ Use controls for interactive props

Example structure:
```typescript
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react'
import { Button } from './button'

const meta: Meta<typeof Button> = {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  component: Button,
  tags: ['autodocs'],
}

export default meta
type Story = StoryObj<typeof Button>

export const Default: Story = {
  args: {
    children: 'Button',
  },
}
```

## Git and Version Control

- ✅ Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- ✅ Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
- ✅ Commit working code only
- ❌ Don't commit `node_modules`, `.env.local`, or build artifacts (already in .gitignore)

## Tone of Voice & Content Guidelines

### Core Principles
The portfolio content should be:
- **Readable** - Clear, concise, easy to understand
- **Professional** - Well-written and credible
- **Confident** - Shows ability without being boastful
- **Humble** - Collaborative, not show-offy
- **Specific** - Uses concrete details and metrics, not superlatives

### Writing Style

#### 1. Lead with Outcomes, Not Effort
Focus on what was achieved and its impact, not the process of doing it.

- ✅ "Redesigned the platform, increasing user retention by 40%"
- ✅ "Built the Native Mobile Design System from the ground up"
- ❌ "Was responsible for redesigning the platform"
- ❌ "Took a lead role in the creation of the design system"

#### 2. Use Active Voice and Strong Verbs
Be direct and use powerful action verbs.

Strong verbs to use:
- Created, built, designed, delivered, shipped
- Established, introduced, implemented
- Led (not "took a lead role in")

Weak phrases to avoid:
- ❌ "Was responsible for" → ✅ "Led" or just describe what you did
- ❌ "Took a lead role in" → ✅ "Led" or "Created"
- ❌ "Involved in" → ✅ "Designed" or "Built"
- ❌ "Worked on" → ✅ "Designed" or "Created"
- ❌ "Owner and curator of" → ✅ "Built and maintain"
- ❌ "Responsibilities included" → ✅ "Designed the end-to-end experience"

#### 3. Be Specific, Not Superlative
Use concrete details, metrics, and specifics instead of vague praise or buzzwords.

- ✅ "Serving 30,000+ property investors"
- ✅ "40% confidence uplift in user testing"
- ✅ "First in the company to integrate AI into the design process"
- ❌ "Pioneering AI-integrated workflows"
- ❌ "Revolutionary new approach"
- ❌ "Cutting-edge technology"
- ❌ "Game-changing solution"

Avoid these buzzwords:
- Pioneering, revolutionary, cutting-edge, game-changing
- Groundbreaking, innovative (unless backed by specifics)
- World-class, best-in-class, leading

#### 4. Show Humility Through Collaboration
Acknowledge teamwork and let the work speak for itself.

- ✅ "Working with the product team, we transformed..."
- ✅ "Built a React Native mobile app from the ground up"
- ❌ "I single-handedly transformed..."
- ❌ "I pioneered a revolutionary approach..."

#### 5. Keep It Concise
Remove unnecessary words and compress long lists to the most important items.

- ✅ "Integrated AI into the design process through code-first prototyping and custom agents"
- ❌ "Pioneering new ways of working to embed AI into our workflow including: business impact modeling; AI-enabled prototyping directly in our codebase; synthesizing test results and research in Notion to create a searchable resource database; creation of bespoke agents..."

When listing achievements:
- Focus on the 2-3 most impressive items
- Combine related items
- Remove obvious or less impactful details

#### 6. Let Details Speak for Themselves
Impressive specifics don't need promotional language around them.

- ✅ "Code-first prototyping directly in the codebase"
- ✅ "Built custom agents like CopyKat, a context-aware copywriting tool"
- ❌ "Pioneering code-first prototyping"
- ❌ "Revolutionary AI agent CopyKat"

The fact that you built prototypes in the codebase is impressive enough without calling it "pioneering".

### Grammar and Style Rules

#### Punctuation
- ✅ ALWAYS use Oxford commas: "design, code, and test"
- ✅ Hyphenate compound adjectives: "code-first prototyping", "AI-enhanced experiences"
- ✅ Hyphenate when used as adjectives: "user-facing", "client-facing", "data-led", "in-house"
- ✅ Use "self-assessment" not "self assessment"
- ✅ Use semicolons (;) for parenthetical breaks or to introduce elaborations
- ❌ DO NOT use em dashes (—) for any purpose

#### Capitalization
- ✅ Proper names and technologies: "Next.js", "React Native", "Cursor", "Figma", "AI"
- ✅ Official names: "Making Tax Digital" (when referring to HMRC's program)
- ❌ Don't capitalize: "ai", "react native", "nextjs"

#### Number Style
- ✅ Use "+" for approximate large numbers: "30,000+", "15,000+"
- ✅ Use commas in numbers over 999: "4.5 million", "30,000"
- ✅ Include context with percentages: "40% confidence uplift", "90% said it was clear"

#### Sentence Structure
- ✅ Vary sentence length for readability
- ✅ Keep most sentences under 25 words
- ✅ Break complex ideas into shorter statements
- ❌ Avoid run-on sentences with multiple clauses

### Content Structure

#### Case Study Sections
Follow this pattern for case studies:
1. **Problem Statement** - Clear, user-focused problem (starting with "As a [user]...")
2. **Discovery** - Research findings with specific metrics
3. **Solution** - What was built and key decisions
4. **Impact** - Concrete results and metrics

#### Experience Summaries
Keep role summaries to 1-2 paragraphs:
- **Paragraph 1**: Core responsibilities and scope (who you served, what you built)
- **Paragraph 2**: Key achievements and notable work (focus on 2-3 highlights)

For older/smaller roles, use a single paragraph.

### Example Transformations

#### Before and After: GetGround Summary

❌ **Before:**
> Lead Product Designer responsible for multiple features across the GetGround customer platform, allowing 30,000 investors to manage their property investments from sourcing, to bookkeeping, to tax submissions and portfolio optimization. Also owner and curator of our Capcom design system.
>
> Most recently delivered the new bookkeeping and tax submissions area from end to end, whilst pioneering new ways of working to embed AI into our workflow. This included: business impact modelling; AI-enabled prototyping directly in our codebase; synthesising test results and research in Notion to create a searchable resource database; creation of bespoke agents such as CopyKat, a copywriting agent with GetGround context and tone of voice baked in to a Slackbot.

✅ **After:**
> Lead Product Designer for multiple features across the GetGround platform, serving 30,000+ property investors. Built and maintain the Capcom design system.
>
> Recently delivered the bookkeeping and tax submissions area end-to-end, integrating AI into the design process through code-first prototyping in Next.js and custom agents like CopyKat, a context-aware copywriting tool.

**Key improvements:**
- Removed "responsible for" (passive)
- Changed "owner and curator" to "built and maintain" (active)
- Removed "pioneering" (let work speak for itself)
- Condensed long list to most impressive items
- Made it clear what CopyKat is without excessive detail

#### Before and After: Sage Summary

❌ **Before:**
> Took a lead role in the creation and delivery of the Sage Individual native app for Android and iOS. Targeted the UKs 4.5 million small business owners, Sage individual allowed users to tracking income and expenses, get paid faster using native tap to pay, send and receive invoices, and submit tax obligations.

✅ **After:**
> Created and delivered the Sage Individual native app for Android and iOS, targeting the UK's 4.5 million small business owners with features for expense tracking, native tap-to-pay, and tax submissions.

**Key improvements:**
- "Took a lead role in the creation and delivery" → "Created and delivered" (more direct)
- Fixed "UK's" apostrophe
- Fixed verb tense consistency
- Tightened sentence structure
- Added hyphens to compound adjectives

### Quick Reference: Common Fixes

| Weak Phrase | Strong Alternative |

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add component-name
```
- ✅ Components are added to `components/ui/component-name/`
- ✅ Review and customize component to match project patterns
- ✅ Create stories for new components

### Adding New Routes
- ✅ Create `app/route-name/page.tsx`
- ✅ Add metadata for SEO
- ✅ Include loading and error states if needed
- ✅ Follow kebab-case naming

### Adding Dependencies
- ✅ Check if functionality exists in current dependencies first
- ✅ Prefer lighter alternatives when possible
- ✅ Update package.json with specific versions
- ✅ Document why the dependency is needed

## Quick Reference

### Common Patterns
```typescript
// Button with icon
<Button>
  <Icon className="size-4" />
  Click me
</Button>

// Conditional rendering with animation
{isVisible && (
  <div className="animate-fade-in">
    Content
  </div>
)}

// Form field
<div className="space-y-2">
  <Label htmlFor="field">Label</Label>
  <Input id="field" placeholder="Placeholder" />
</div>

// Grid layout
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  {/* content */}
</div>

// Card with sections
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    {/* content */}
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### Path Aliases
- `@/components` → `./components`
- `@/lib` → `./lib`
- `@/app` → `./app`

## Summary: Core Principles

1. **Never hardcode design values** - Always use design tokens
2. **Follow Next.js conventions** - Use App Router patterns correctly
3. **Use TypeScript everywhere** - Type safety is non-negotiable
4. **Keep components composable** - Small, single-responsibility components
5. **Maintain consistency** - Follow established patterns in the codebase
6. **Document non-obvious code** - Help future developers (including yourself)
7. **Test component behavior** - Not implementation details
8. **Build accessible interfaces** - Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, semantic HTML
9. **Optimize performance** - Tree-shaking, lazy loading, bundle analysis
10. **Start simple, add intentionally** - Don't over-engineer
